		<h1>Kevin's Bio</h1>
		<p class="bio">I am an aspiring computer/software engineer. I was born in Korea in 1998 and moved to the States when I was 8. Since moving to America, I marveled at the 'breathtaking' New Jersey scenery and cowered at the shift in culture.</p>
		<p>I like to play the acoustic and electric guitar (which would be better if I could sing). I also began to go to the gym this school year. I hope to become more swole by the time I graduate. Sometimes, I like to go out and watch the sunrise in the morning. That's all... Thanks for reading!</p>
